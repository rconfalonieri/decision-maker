HOWTO:

1. Lanch the decision-maker.jar (double click or "java -jar decision-maker.jar")
2. Load a .dm file which contains the description of a decision making under uncertainty problem
3. Select the reasoner and the attitude of the decision maker and press "Compute"
4. Press "Details" for internal computation details

--------------------------------------

REASONERS and PORTABILITY:

The prototype provides the implementation of the algorithms based on the LPPODs and LPODs semantics, 
as well as a DLV compliant implementation.

The LPODs based algorithms are implemented by using the "psmodels" solver (available at http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/smodels/priority/)
The LPPODs based algorithms are implemented by using the "posPsmodels" solver (developed by one of the author, https://github.com/rconfalonieri/LPPODsolver)
The DLV compliant algorithms are implemented by using the "DLV system" (available at www.dlvsystem.com).

The DLV implementation can be run on OS X, Linux Ubuntu, and Windows.

The LPODs and LPPODs implementations can be run on OS X and Linux Ubuntu only,
since the components of the psmodels and posPsmodels solvers are not available for Windows.
